1) Edit and copy the sample config file to ~/.Nsploit
2) copy the nselib files into your Nmap nselib which is normally under /usr/share/nmap or /usr/local/share/nmap
3) copy the scripts files into your Nmap scripts dir which is normally under /usr/share/nmap or /usr/local/share/nmap
4) run nmap --script-updatedb to add your scripts to the Nmap database
5) make sure that the lua expat package is installed for your OS
6) in some cases, Nmap is not aware of the correct install location of the lua expat shared objects, you may need to add additional symlinks in /usr/local/share/lua and /usr/local/lib/lua
